we are developing a chat frontend for a chatbot to either deepseek or openrouter.
Voice is the main input method, and TTS the main output method.
TTS should be smooth and natural.
When making changes to fix or add something, do not make changes to the code that is already working.  Limit the scope of the changes to the specific issue.
